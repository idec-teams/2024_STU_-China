# Background
Extremophiles, a remarkable class of microorganisms, have mastered the art of survival in conditions once deemed inhospitable. These extremophiles inhabit a spectrum of extremes, from the scorching heat of geysers to the frigid depths of the ocean, and from the caustic alkalinity of soda lakes to the crushing pressures of the deep sea. Their existence is a testament to life's extraordinary adaptability and tenacity.



The taxonomy of extremophiles is intricately linked to their preferred environmental extremes. Thermophiles and hyperthermophiles, for instance, are commonly found in geothermal features, where they thrive in temperatures that would be lethal to most lifeforms. Psychrophiles, on the other hand, are at home in the coldest reaches of our planet, from the Antarctic ice to the deep sea. Acidophiles and alkaliphiles have evolved to cope with acidic and alkaline environments, respectively, while halophiles areatease in the saline-rich habitats such as salt flats. Halophiles flourish in high-salinity environments like salt pans, and piezophiles (or barophiles) thrive under extreme pressure, such as in deep-sea trenches. Radiophiles standout for their ability to tolerate high levels of radiation, offering valuable insights into DNA repair and survival mechanisms. At present, halophiles and thermophiles are most studied because they have great industrial application value.



A notable example is the thermostable DNA polymerase from Thermus aquaticus, which enabled the development of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, for which Kary Mullis was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in  1993.  Other  applications include the degradation of halogenated compounds by halophilic  dehalogenases  and  the  use  of extremophile  lipases  in  the  synthesis  of enantiomerically pure drugs.



The study of extremophiles is not merely an academic pursuit but also holds significant implications for astrobiology and biotechnology. Astrobiologists are particularly interested in these organisms as they provide clues to the potential existence of life on other planets. Meanwhile, biotechnologists have recognized the industrial potential of extremophiles, especially halophiles and thermophiles, for their unique metabolic pathways  and  enzyme  production.  Extremophile-derived  enzymes,  or extremozymes, are prized for their robustness and functionality under conditions that would typically denature conventional enzymes. These enzymes have become indispensable in various industries, offering more efficient, environmentally sustainable, and cost-effective solutions. They are used in high-temperature industrial processes, inorganic solvents, and under extreme pH conditions that would inactivate non-extremozymes. A notable example is the thermostable DNA polymerase from ***Thermus aquaticus***, which enabled the development of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, for which Kary Mullis was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1993. Halophilic dehalogenases can break down halogenated compounds, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), in salt-affected soils or wastewater treatment facilities. Lipases from extremophiles can catalyze the resolution of racemic mixtures into their enantiomerically pure components in organic solvents, crucial for the production of enantiomerically pure drugs.  Enzymes from extremophiles are employed in the synthesis of flavors, fragrances, and biofuel production, where their solvent resistance allows for reactions to be carried out in the organic phase.



Beyond their unique enzymatic profiles, extremophiles serve as holistic solutions across diverse sectors, including environmental management, pharmaceuticals, and synthetic biology. Their  unparalleled ability to withstand extreme conditions presents innovative pathways to address contemporary challenges. For instance, thermophilic bacteria, which thrive in high-temperature settings, are harnessed for the remediation of oil spills, transforming complex hydrocarbons into simpler, less harmful substances. Similarly, halophiles are leveraged in the remediation of saline or alkaline industrial effluents, where traditional microbial strategies fall short. These extremophiles can be genetically  tailored  to  fix  nitrogen,  solubilize  phosphates, or synthesize  plant growth-promoting  hormones under saline conditions, thus enhancing soil health and sustainability with reduced reliance on chemical fertilizers. In recent years, extremophiles, particularly halophiles, have emerged as key  players in the economical production of Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), a biodegradable alternative to  plastics.  Next-generation   industrial   biotechnology   (NGIB),   anchored   in   extremophilic  microorganisms,  offers  a  competitive  edge in overcoming current industrial challenges.  NGIB employs extremophiles that are resilient to pollution, enabling a sustainable, continuous, and energy- efficient biological treatment process. This approach utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize the use of lower-cost substrates and minimize freshwater consumption. A prominent example of NGIB is  the development of engineered ***Halomonas*** species, designed to operate under high salinity and alkaline pH, as an industrial workhorse. This strain exemplifies the ideal chassis cell with multiple advantages: the capability to utilize seawater, conserving freshwater resources; the elimination of sterilization due to the innate alkaline and saline environment; and the intrinsic ability of engineered strains to self- aggregate, simplifying downstream processing and reducing costs.



One of the main challenges in extremophile research is the difficulty of culturing and identifying these organisms in laboratory settings, which often cannot replicate the exact conditions of their natural habitats. Advances in genomic and metagenomic analysis are helping to overcome this barrier, allowing scientists to study the genetic makeup of extremophiles without the need to culture them. However, identifying novel extremophiles remains difficult due to the current lack of genomic DNA sequence-based methods for their identification.



In recent years, AI technolog, particularly deep learning, has been extensively applied in biology, including structure prediction, gene editing   and  drug design The development of  these technologies  relies  on  extensive  data  accumulation.  Fortunately,  the  rapid advancement of  gene sequencing technology,  including next-generation and third-generation sequencing, has led to databases such as ExtremeDB, HaloDom, and ThermoBase, which record the genomic information of extremophiles, especially halophiles and thermophiles, providing a foundation for using AI to identify extremophiles.



In this study, we have established a deep learning model named iExtreme, which excels at identifying extremophilic microorganisms and predicting their optimal living conditions. Utilizing iExtreme, we have curated and enhanced extremophilic microbial genome and proteome databases, and developed methods for extremozyme mining. Furthermore, by integrating phage-assisted non-continuous evolution (PANCE)  in droplets,we have enhanced the performance of extremozymes.
